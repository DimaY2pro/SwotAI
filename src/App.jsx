You are an expert career development coach specializing in personalized SWOT analysis.
Your task is to generate a structured SWOT analysis framework based on the user's provided career goal.

Career Goal: "${careerGoal}"

For EACH of the four SWOT categories (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), you must:
1. Generate exactly 5 insightful and distinct questions that will help the user critically assess that category in relation to their stated career goal.
2. For each generated question, provide a concise, illustrative sample answer (1-2 sentences) that is also tailored to the career goal. This sample answer should exemplify the type of reflection expected.

The entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or explanations before or after the JSON object.
The JSON object must have the following structure (showing 3 for brevity, but you must generate 5 for each category):
{
  "strengths": [
    { "question": "Generated question 1 for strengths relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 1 for strengths." },
    { "question": "Generated question 2 for strengths relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 2 for strengths." },
    { "question": "Generated question 3 for strengths relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 3 for strengths." },
    { "question": "Generated question 4 for strengths relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 4 for strengths." },
    { "question": "Generated question 5 for strengths relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 5 for strengths." }
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    { "question": "Generated question 1 for weaknesses relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 1 for weaknesses." },
    { "question": "Generated question 2 for weaknesses relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 2 for weaknesses." },
    { "question": "Generated question 3 for weaknesses relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 3 for weaknesses." },
    { "question": "Generated question 4 for weaknesses relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 4 for weaknesses." },
    { "question": "Generated question 5 for weaknesses relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 5 for weaknesses." }
  ],
  "opportunities": [
    { "question": "Generated question 1 for opportunities relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 1 for opportunities." },
    { "question": "Generated question 2 for opportunities relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 2 for opportunities." },
    { "question": "Generated question 3 for opportunities relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 3 for opportunities." },
    { "question": "Generated question 4 for opportunities relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 4 for opportunities." },
    { "question": "Generated question 5 for opportunities relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 5 for opportunities." }
  ],
  "threats": [
    { "question": "Generated question 1 for threats relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 1 for threats." },
    { "question": "Generated question 2 for threats relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 2 for threats." },
    { "question": "Generated question 3 for threats relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 3 for threats." },
    { "question": "Generated question 4 for threats relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 4 for threats." },
    { "question": "Generated question 5 for threats relevant to ${careerGoal}?", "sampleAnswer": "Sample answer 5 for threats." }
  ]
}

Ensure the questions are thought-provoking and the sample answers are practical examples.
Replace "{careerGoal}" in your actual output with the user's provided career goal where appropriate in the generated questions and sample answers if it enhances specificity, but prioritize natural language.
    `.replace(/\$\{careerGoal\}/g, careerGoal); // Ensure all placeholders are replaced.

    console.log("Attempting to generate full AI SWOT structure for career goal:", careerGoal);
    // For debugging the exact prompt being sent:
    // console.log("Full prompt for SWOT structure generation:", promptText);
