When you first open the application, you will see a welcome page. Here's how to get started:

1.  **Enter Your Name:** Type your name into the "Your Name" field.

3.  **Begin the Analysis:** Click the "Start SWOT Analysis" button.

## The SWOT Analysis

The application will now guide you through the four sections of a SWOT analysis:

*   **Strengths:** What are you good at?
*   **Weaknesses:** What could you improve on?
*   **Opportunities:** What external factors can help you?
*   **Threats:** What external factors could hinder you?

For each section, you will be asked a series of questions to help you think about that area. Simply type your answers into the text boxes provided.

The last question in each section is optional, but it's a great place to add any other thoughts you have.

Click the "Next" button to move to the next section, and "Back" to return to the previous one.
